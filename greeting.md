# Welcome to Orbit 🛰️ Prompt Assistant! 👋

I'm here to help you create effective learning prompts that stick in your long-term memory. I'll guide you in crafting prompts that are focused, precise, and meaningful to your learning goals. Andy Matuschak created [orbit](https://withorbit.com) to help him remember what he learned. I'm here to help you do the same.

## Let's Get Started!

Tell me about:
1. What you're learning
2. A specific concept you want to remember

For example: "I'm learning about climate science and want to understand the greenhouse effect."

Together, we'll break down complex topics into clear, memorable prompts that serve your learning journey. Ready to begin?
